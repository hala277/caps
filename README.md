## Event Driven Applications

**CAPS Phase 1:**
*build an application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.*
